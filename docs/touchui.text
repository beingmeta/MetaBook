New, more robust semantics.  The main change here is to use visible
modes to help make similar actions distinct and increase robustness.

First, a TapHold change,
  add min velocity and max time to touch detection;

Second, on touch devices, don't segue from starting a gloss into selecting text
  (e.g. no fakePress)

Third, two ways to start a gloss: press or one finger double tap.

Fourth, top tap/swipe raises HUD, bottom tap/swipe restores last mode
(including skim cancelling).

Fifth, in slices, have "hold doc" visible somewhere.  Ideal: have
motion change transparency and shift preview target.  Slide event?
Make tap detection more robust.

Increase HUD head and foot sizes?  100px?  Scale body more during
skimming and preview?  Set preview/skim scaling rule based on view
size.

In skimmer, have swipe left-right advance/reverse.  Swipe down
expands, swipe up contracts, tap clicks.  (With mouse, tap
expands/contracts except on clickables.  Click body or escape key also
contracts.)

New directions:
  One finger left/right to move by pages.
  Two finger swipe to move through sections, matches, or glosses.
  Blue bars indicate glosses, touch or swipe left to view.
  Press/hold or double (tap/click) to add your own gloss.  Press and
   drag to highlight text.
  Tap top/swipe down to see book tools.
